# Parseargs

**A command line option parser for shell scripts.**

[![Build and Test](https://github.com/rakus/parseargs/actions/workflows/verify.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rakus/parseargs/actions/workflows/verify.yaml)

Parseargs parses given shell script parameters based on a given
option definition. Depending on the given options shell code is
generated that can be evaluated using the shells `eval` builtin.

## A Simple Example

The following is a fragment for a shell script that supports
the options
* `-l` & `--long` to produce some long, more detailed output
* `-o FILE` & `--out-file FILE` to set the file to write to

Additionally multiple input files can be given as arguments.

```bash
#!/bin/sh
script_name="$(basename "$0")"
eval "$(parseargs -n "$script_name" -o 'l:long#details,o:out-file=output' )"
if [ -n "$details"] ; then
    echo "Long detailed output requested"
fi
echo "Output file: '$output'"
echo "Arguments: $*"
```

Parseargs parses the given options and creates shell code to set
variables. It also prints error messages and exits the script on
unknown options.

The [Tutorial] explains all features using examples.

## Building

Normal cargo commands can be used.

Additional steps are provided via Makefile.
Run `make help` to get help on the available targets.

### Prerequisites

Some additional tools are needed for building and testing Parseargs.

**Basics**

* cargo get - To extract info from `Cargo.toml`. (`cargo install cargo-get`).
* [ShellCheck] - Linter for shell code. Used in tests. Install using your package manager. As a shell programmer you should use it anyway.

**Documentation**

* Asciidoctor - Used to build tutorial and man page. See [Asciidoctor install page].
* Pygments - Syntax highlighting of shell code in tutorial. See [Pygments install page].

**Package Build**

* cargo generate-rpm - Pure Rust RPM builder. (`cargo install cargo-generate-rpm`)
* cargo deb - Pure Rust Debian package builder. (`cargo install cargo-deb`)

## TODO

This tool is in an early state and there are areas that need further
improvements

* Handle arguments with invalid UTF-8 chars. Today it just error exits.
* To many Strings where string slices should be used -- most likely a general Rust newbie problem.
